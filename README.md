# Presentation about the MEAN-Stack

In my third semester I had a presentation about the MEAN-Stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express.js, Angular and Node.js. This is an example project for creating a MEAN-Application and how to easily deploy it. This source code was shown during the presentation.
